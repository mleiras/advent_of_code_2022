## My Solutions

I'm currently studying Bioinformatics at the University of Minho - Portugal. 

I'm learning to program in python and this is a daily challenge that motivates me to improve my programming skills.

I'm sharing my solutions with the **[ZTM community](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Advent-of-Code-2022)** and I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.
